# SKETCH FILES FOR FUNDIT

Using Kactus.io to manage version control for our fundit sketch files. 

https://kactus.io/

1. download the app
2. sign into github within the kactus app
3. click on the repo you want to work with and clone locally
4. open the sketch file directly in sketch, make edits, save - go back to kactus
5. commit your saved changes to github within kactus for them to be saved in the repo.

This allows for branches and all sorts of git workflow features.
